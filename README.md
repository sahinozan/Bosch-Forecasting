# Bosch Senior Project

Conducted a thorough analysis on the dataset including seasonality, PCAF, and ACF. Trends are detected and generated a new dataset according to the gathered insights. 

Two different forecasting models are created and tuned (hyperparameter) according to the dataset.

Models used for forecasting:
- ARIMA
- SARIMA/SARIMAX
- LSTM (Long Short-term Memory)

Libraries Used:
- Tensorflow
- Keras
- Openpyxl
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Numpy
- Stats
